These are the schematic and board files for the external circuit part of the
project.  This circuit is driven by the Raspberry Pi and translates GPIO pins
to the game console.

These files were created with the free version of [Eagle][] v7.7.0.

 - sega.sch (Eagle Schematic)
 - sega.png (screenshot of the schematic)
 - sega.brd (Eagle Board)

The board file can be uploaded directly to [DirtyPCBs][] to be printed.
